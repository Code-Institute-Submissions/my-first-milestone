# First milestone project - Code Institute

I present my portfolio website to prospective employers. I present the technologies i have been learning and a bit about myself, skills, testimonials and a contact form. I have chosen not to include my cv because in this moment in time it doesn't give me advantages for my prospective users. I have testimonials instead that reflects my personality. The skills that are shown is not accurate but instead just a example of how to show my future skills.

**See my demo [here](https://tess2019.github.io/my-first-milestone/)**


## **UX**

My goal with the website was to make it easy to overview. The information on the site is kept short not to lose the interest from the user but still enough to make the page interesting. Few pictures and soft colors for a warm and welcoming feel of the page.

I wanted to provide a enough context to make employers to want to contact me. To do that i show my skills and a about me page as well as links to my Facebook, LinkedIn profile and my GitHub for more content.

 

## **Technologies**

HTML

CSS

Bootstrap (4.3.x)

## **Features**

Navbar

Contact form

Modal

Modal shows the invalid message.

Media links in footer

Copyright

### **Features Left to Implement**

I would  like to add my CV as a link and with a download button when i have done my program. The skills chart are to be altered when i have the different skills for real. Also show work snippets from my upcoming projects and link them from my homepage. I chose not to have scrollspy for now because the small size of my page. But as i add content this maybe needs to be implemented. i also want to add Form Validation for separate Modals into contact form.

## **Testing**

My intended outcome was of providing a showcase of myself and my personality. This page is just a base to add on projects and further effects.

My page is providing a live version. My social media profiles shows by clicking on the icons in the footer.

In the Contact Form the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'message' fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit. When all field are valid, the page will reload. But when clicking the send button you will be directed to a error noting that informs you of why the mail not working.

All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.

I run my code trough W3C validator html and css to see errors. I copy and paste my code into the section of direct input and press check.

During the testing phase, I realized that the responsiveness was the hardest for me to figure out in difrent browsers. I did thought that bootstrap explained a lot in turn of responsiveness. To fix some of the problems i added in media queries. I have to continue learning how to use media queries though.

I started the process in C9 and deployed all my projects to Github. But after **a lot** of trouble in C9 were my work suddenly disappeared a lot of times even though i saved my work a lot of times i gave up and started to get really stressed out. I installed Brackets and started all over again. At the time of stress i forgot to deploy my all work into github, now i have learned my hard lesson.
